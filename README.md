# Basic HTTP Server Implementation

In this, implement grep like functionality

## Inspiration

Inspired by [codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/).

## HTTP

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, we are building a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

## Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.82)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
