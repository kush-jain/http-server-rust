# Basic HTTP Server Implementation

In this, implement grep like functionality

## Inspiration

Inspired by [codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/).

## HTTP

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, we are building a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

## Features

- Concurrency
- Supports encoding headers (gzip)
- Supports file read and write endpoints
